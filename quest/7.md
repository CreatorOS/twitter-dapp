# Getting the Tweet which is recorded on the ethereum blockchain network
For reading the tweets from the ethereum blockchain network. We are creating two function named ```getAllTweets``` and ```getTweetsByUser```.

```
function getAllTweets() public view returns(Tweet [] memory){
    return tweets;
}
```
We have created a `getAllTweets` that takes no parameter that is a public function, which can be called with the contract itself and have a view modifier which means no state variable will be modified and can ready the state variable and will return Tweet array variable which is created to store all the Tweet. At the end of `getAllTweets` function, the function returns the tweets state variable which acts as a database for this contract.

```
 function getTweetByUser(address _senter) public view returns(Tweet [] memory){
        uint totalCounts;
        for(uint a = 0; a <= tweets.length-1; a++){
            if(tweets[a].tweeter == _senter){
                totalCounts += 1;
            }
        }
        Tweet [] memory _tweet = new Tweet[](totalCounts);
        uint j;
        for(uint a = 0; a <= tweets.length-1; a++){
            if(Tweets[a].tweeter == _senter){
                _tweet[j] = tweets[a];
                j += 1;
            }
        }
        return _tweet;
    }
}
```
In `getTweetByUser` function we took a parameter as a tweeter address which will then an array of Tweet, the tweeter created. There are 2 for looping in the function in which the first one counts the number of tweets the sender had created and makes a temporary static or fixed array named `_tweet` of Tweet data types. The second for loops is for the assignment of the tweet to the temporary variable created as `__tweet` and at last, it returns the temporary variable by fulfilling the return type as expected.
