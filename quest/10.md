# End
Now we are at the end of this series one. Hope you enjoy the first series by creating a smart contract and playing with the UI. 

What we are going to do in series two? 

(1) Adding more features like a retweet, setting up Twitter handle username, uploading your profile picture, sending a personal message to any user, searching user by username, and adding a like button to each tweet.

(2) We need major improvement in UI. (I will change the CSS library from Bootstrap Framework to Tailwind CSS utility Library that will enhance the UI and UX. If you have some suggestions about UI or design then please DM)

(3) Getting some real and hard stuff done like gas optimization and interacting with inline assembly or bytecode

(4) Writing Test scripts

(5) Deploying on testnet.

<b>If you have any suggestion or change you think it should be made then you can make a pull request or DM me on Github or Discord </b>
