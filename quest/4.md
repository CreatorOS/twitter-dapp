# Structure of Tweet
<b>If you have experience with C/C++ programming language then it will be easy to code in Solidity because Solidity and C/C++ are both statically typed language and solidity borrow some syntax from C/C++.</b>

A Dapp Twitter is made by Tweets which is Tweeted by a different user. We can define our structure of Tweet in solidity by 
```
struct Tweet{}
```


Here we have given a basic structure of Tweet that doesn't contain any information about the tweet. For that, we need to define some basic structure of data that contains information about Tweet. We can have four information resources like tweet body, a unique hash for that tweet, a time when the tweet was created, and the owner of the tweet.

```
struct Tweet{
    string body;
    bytes32 hash;
    uint time;
    address tweeter;
}
```
Let's Break into pieces. ```string body``` defines the tweet of the body which is a string, ```bytes32 hash``` is a unique hash generated at the time of the creation of tweet. It will help to index the tweet easily from the database. ```uint time``` is a time variable that can store an unsigned integer up to 2^256-1 but here it will store a UNIX timestamp (UNIX timestamp is a way to track the time in running total of seconds from January 1, 1970). ```address tweeter``` is an address variable that stores a 40 hexadecimal character long followed by ```0x``` which is also known as a unique account address created by Wallet.
